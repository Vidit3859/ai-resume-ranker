# 🤖 AI-Powered Resume Ranker

An NLP-based web application that automatically ranks candidate resumes based on their relevance to a given job description.

This project simulates a simplified **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** used by HR teams to shortlist candidates efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

- Extracts text from PDF resumes  
- Performs NLP preprocessing using SpaCy  
- Converts text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF  
- Calculates similarity using cosine similarity  
- Automatically ranks multiple resumes  
- Flask-based web interface  
- Modern responsive UI  
- Download ranking report in CSV format

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a job description  
2. Uploads multiple resumes (PDF)  
3. System preprocesses resume text  
4. TF-IDF vectorization converts text into feature vectors  
5. Cosine similarity computes matching score  
6. Resumes are ranked based on relevance  
7. HR can download ranking report
